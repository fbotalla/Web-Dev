        <div  style="float: left;">
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro is a Portuguese soccer superstar. By 2003 — when he was just 16 years old — Manchester United paid £12 million (over $14 million U.S. dollars) to sign him, a record fee for a player of his age. 
               In the 2004 FA Cup final, Ronaldo scored Manchester's first three goals and helped them capture the championship. He set a franchise record for goals scored in 2008, before Real Madrid paid a record $131 million for his services the following year.  
               Among his many accomplishments, he has won a record-tying five Ballon d'Or awards for player of the year, and led Portugal to an emotional victory in the 2016 European Championship. In July 2018, Ronaldo embarked on a new phase of his career by signing with Italian Serie A club Juventus.</p>

        <div  style="float: left;">
                <p>Miralem Pjanic is a midfielder of FC Juventus. He was born on 2 April 1990 in the city of Tuzla, current Bosnia and Herzegovina.
                   Miralem began his youth career in 1997 entering the academy of FC Schifflange 95. The young footballer spent seven years in the club’s academy until he agreed to join FC Metz youth academy in France. By the year 2007 Pjanic had been through with studying, starting his professional football career. 
                   In 2007 Miralem Pjanic signed a professional contract with the French Metz becoming its apprentice for three years. The young Bosnian made a promising start in the 2007/08 season netting 3 goals in 32 appearances.
                   The next season Pjanic was linked with Olympique Lyonnais, which he finally joined. In the summer of 2008 Miralem agreed to the contract with Lyon, tying him to the club for the next three years. During this period Pjanic established himself as a key attacking midfielder making appearances with the first team almost in every match. The head coach gave Pjanic an opportunity to play 90 games with Lyon, where the young Bosnian scored 10 goals.    
                   In 2011 Miralem didn’t stop at what had been accomplished. When the footballer was offered to join the first team of the Italian Roma, he was happy to agree to the contract. Pjanic wanted to start a new era in his career and the Roman club appropriately suited for such an occasion. Miralem didn’t regret moving to the Italian club, since he became the first team regular being a key midfielder in the team.
                   From 2006 through 2007 Miralem Pjanic was called up to Luxembourg U-17 and U-19 teams scoring 6 goals in 7 matches. Since 2008 he has played 31 matches and netted 4 goals for Bosnia and Herzegovina national team.</p>

        <img src="Giorgio_Chiellini.jpg" alt="Ronaldo" width="460" height="345">
        <div  style="float: left;">
                <p>Giorgio Chiellini is a relatively young footballer, born in 1984.
                   At the dawn of his career, Chiellini played for A.S. Livorno Calcio youth team in different leagues of the Italian Championship. Back then Giorgio was used primarily as a wing-back.                      
                   For 4 seasons at Livorno Chiellini was not performing outstanding football. It was only in the last season at Livorno when Giorgio managed to claim his lineup spot. After that he was scouted by Juventus which experienced certain staff problems after corruption scandal and consequent relegation from Serie A.                      
                   Nevertheless, after the transfer Chiellini did not get a chance to play in the club and was loaned out to Fiorentina immediately. Here Giorgio proved to be a secure and talented defender, and after returning to the home club was granted a place in Juventus starting lineup. The only change was that Juve senior coach put him in the center of defense (as his height helped competing for high balls).                       
                   This is how the career of one of the best central backs in the Italian league started. In 2008 Chiellini was called the ‘Serie A Defender of the Year’ and was later invited to play for the Italian national football team. Presently Giorgio is the key defender at Juventus and in the national team. Many top European clubs offered hefty sums of money for Chiellini but he remained loyal to the Old Lady.  
                   Quite recently Giorgio Chiellini extended his contract with Juventus again until 2015, with 3.5 million Euros annual salary. Despite not being well paid by top football players’ standards, Giorgio remains faithful to bianco-neri which is an attitude to be respected. Even after the radical change of the Italian national team’s roster, the new head coach entrusted Chiellini to be the backbone of the defensive line.</p>

        <img src="Wojciech_Szczesny.jpg" alt="Ronaldo" width="460" height="345">
        <div  style="float: left;">
                <p>Wojciech Tomasz Szczęsny is a goalkeeper of London side Arsenal and the Poland national team. He was born on 18 April 1990 in Warsaw, Poland.
                   Szczęsny was a trainee of the Warsaw side Agrykola youth academy. At the age of 15, the Polish footballer impressed the coaching staff of Legia Warsaw and they asked him to train with them.
                   In 2006 Wojciech moved to Arsenal. The player made a good showing in friendly matches of Legia and Arsenal negotiated his move to their ranks. Later the Polish footballer began to make starts in the youth team of the new club.                       
                   Szczęsny got off on the right foot in the youth academy. In the summer 2007 he signed a contract with the London side club. In 2007/2008 Wojciech made 23 appearances for Arsenal youth team, which lifted the FA Youth Cup.                       
                   In September 2008 the keeper signed a new contract with ‘The Gunners’, but the 2008/2009 season was not so successful for Wojciech. Before 2009/2010 Szczęsny joined the first team and made his debut in the match against West Bromwich on 22 September 2009.                       
                   On 20 November 2009, Brentford negotiated the Polish footballer’s loan for a month. Then the loan spell was extended till 31 January and, eventually, Szczęsny stayed in the temporary club till the end of the season.                       
                   On 11 November, Wojciech signed a new contract with Arsenal and became a first-choice goalkeeper. On 16 February, the Polish footballer took part in the UEFA Champions League match against Barcelona.                        
                   On 8 March, Szczęsny made his start in the Champions League return leg against ‘Barça’, but he was substituted in the 19th minute.</p>
